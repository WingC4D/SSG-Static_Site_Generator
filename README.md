## Custom Static Site Generator
- This project is a custom-built Static Site Generator (SSG) developed in Python. It takes Markdown files as input, processes them, and converts them into a complete static website.
- This project was completed as a guided exercise from the Boot.dev platform and represents my learning experience, approximately three months into my coding journey.
---
### Features
- Markdown to HTML Conversion: Parses Markdown content, including headings, paragraphs, code blocks, quotes, ordered and unordered lists, bold, italic, images, and links, transforming it into valid HTML.

- Templating System: Utilizes an HTML template file (template.html) to inject generated content and page titles, ensuring consistent site structure.

- Content and Static Asset Processing: Copies static files (like CSS and images) and processes Markdown content from designated input directories (static and content) into the output directory (docs).

- Dynamic Base Path Handling: Automatically adjusts internal links (href and src attributes) based on a provided base path, crucial for correct deployment on sub-directory hosting environments like GitHub Pages.

- Python 3: For all the core logic and scripting.

- Markdown: Input content format.

- HTML5: Output website format.

- Bash Scripting: For building and running commands.

### How to Run/Build
To generate the static site and run it locally:
- Clone the repository.
- Build the site:
  1. This command `./build.sh` will generate the static HTML and CSS files in the docs/ directory. Make sure to replace /your-repository-name/ with the actual path your project will be served from (e.g., your GitHub repository name if using GitHub Pages). 
  2. Example based on typical GitHub Pages setup:
     ``` bash 
     python3 src/main.py "/SSG-Static_Site_Generator/"
     ```
  3. Serve the site locally - Navigate into the generated docs directory and start a local Python HTTP server.
     ``` bash
     cd docs
     python3 -m http.server 8888
     ```
  4. Then, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8888 to view the generated site.

Generated Site Example
The project includes example content for a "Tolkien Fan Club" website.
